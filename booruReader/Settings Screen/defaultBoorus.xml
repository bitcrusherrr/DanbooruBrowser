<!--
You can manually add new boards to the list and program will pick em up on launch
Usually provider value should be set XML
Every site that has API based on danbooru should work, if not you should bug me about it
Provider type GELBOORULIKE is used for gelbooru based sites as they have different API.

If you want to test what api site has try adding post/index.xml?page=1&tags=and to the address for XML
index.php?page=dapi&s=post&q=index&pid=1 for GELBOORULIKE

Note:this XML file and manual addition are temporary at later stage all addition will be handled within the application and it will also resolve API's by itself
shimmie based sites not supported and support not planned.
