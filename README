This tool grew out from simple wpf exercise into something useable to browse and grab pictures from danbooru like image sites.

You can grab compiled exe straight from here and also you will need to grab dbz.UIComponents.dll. 
Both files will get updated whenever I feel that changes are stable enough.

Note: 
This is a WIP so occasionally some things may break and its not fully feature complete.
Once all features are done I will provide a centralised ClickOnce installer for convinience.

You can now add login details to the boards, you will have to input salt for the board.
For example danbooeu has password salt of choujin-steiner--!PASSWORD!--
booruBrowser looks for !PASSWORD! to put your plaintext password into and convert into hash format.
Other boards might have different salt, you just nbeed to add the !PASSWORD! to the location where password should go.


Rough list of some things that work and that dont:
- Browsing sites that conform to danbooru/gelbooru base API's.
- Image downloading.
- Image previews.
- Searching by tags.
- Centralised download prorgess tracker.
- Basic logging in case something crashes. Log can be found in: %UserName%\AppData\Roaming\BooruReader
- Local Favorites collection. - It sort of works, but needs some tweaking. Ignore it for now. Dont even know if this is of any use.

Nice to have:
- search bar should remember last inputs

Could be cool:
- Instead of starting download straight away, wait for user to hit dl button in the dl tracker screen. This would also make it easier to control amount of download workers.

Feel free to leave suggestions, comments, criticism, whatever.
