This tool grew out from simple wpf exercise into something useable to browse and grab pictures from danbooru like image sites.

You can grab the "bleeding edge" exe file straight from here. It may or may not have weird bugs.

Otherwise you can go to the programs homepage and grab the clickonce installer, which will handle updating etc automaticly whenever I make a new version @ http://www.datazbytes.net/?page_id=119 Chances are the booruReader from there will be slightly less fresh, but it wouldnt have some of the silly dev-only bugs.
