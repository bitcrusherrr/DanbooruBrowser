This tool grew out from simple wpf exercise into something useable to browse and grab pictures from danbooru like image sites.

You can grab compiled exe straight from here. It tends to be updated whenever commits happen.

Note: 
This is a WIP so occasionally some things may break and its not fully feature complete.
Once all features are done I will provide a centralised ClickOnce installer for convinience.

Rough list of some things that work and that dont:
- Browsing sites that conform to danbooru/gelbooru base API's.
- Image downloading.
- Image previews.
- Searching by tags.

Things that dont but will eventually:
- Centralised download prorgess tracker.
- Local Favorites collection.

Nice to have:
- Track favorite artists/tag?
- Pool support

Feel free to leave suggestions, comments, criticism, whatever.
